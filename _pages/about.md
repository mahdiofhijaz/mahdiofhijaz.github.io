<font size="12">  
    A Ph.D. holder with expertise in computational sciences, multiscale simulation, and biomedical research, I develop innovative in-silico methods to solve complex biological challenges such as allostery (long range communication) in proteins. Passionate about bridging science and technology, I aim to drive impactful innovation in drug discovery, personalized healthcare, and data science.
